## Interesting Article on Software Development

I came across an insightful article on The Twelve-Factor App (https://12factor.net/), a methodology for building modern, scalable, and maintainable software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications.

## Why I Found It Interesting

What I really like about this article is how it distills software engineering best practices into twelve clear principles that are easy to follow. It emphasizes ideas like keeping configuration separate from code, treating logs as event streams, and ensuring that applications can scale smoothly.  

Even though it was originally written with SaaS applications in mind, I think these principles apply broadly across software engineering. They encourage developers to think not just about writing code, but also about how that code will behave in production environments, making applications more reliable and easier to maintain.
